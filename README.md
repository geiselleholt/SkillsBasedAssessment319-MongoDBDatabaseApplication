## OBJECTIVES:
- Create a server application with Node, Express, and MongoDB.
- Create a CRUD API using Express and MongoDB.
- Create MongoDB indexes.
- Use MongoDB indexing to make efficient queries.
- Create MongoDB validation rules.
- Use MongoDB validation to ensure data consistency.

## REQUIREMENTS:
- Use at least three different data collections within the database (such as users, posts, or comments) ✅
- Utilize reasonable data modeling practices. ✅
- Create GET routes for all data that should be exposed to the client, using appropriate query commands to retrieve the data from the database. ⭕✅
- Create POST routes for data, as appropriate, using appropriate insertion commands to add data to the database. At least one data collection should allow for client creation via a POST request. ⭕✅
- Create PATCH or PUT routes for data, as appropriate, using appropriate update commands to change data in the database. At least one data collection should allow for client manipulation via a PATCH or PUT request. ⭕✅
- Create DELETE routes for data, as appropriate, using appropriate delete commands to remove data from the database. At least one data collection should allow for client deletion via a DELETE request. ⭕✅
- Include sensible indexes for any and all fields that are queried frequently. For fields that may have a high write-to-read ratio, you may forgo indexes for performance considerations. Make comments of this where applicable. ⭕
- Include sensible MongoDB data validation rules for at least one data collection. ⭕✅
- Populate your application's collections with sample data illustrating the use case of the collections. You must include at least five sample documents per collection. ⭕✅
- Utilize reasonable code organization practices. ✅
- Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit). ⭕
- Commit frequently to the git repository. ⭕✅
- Include a README file that contains a description of your application. ⭕✅
- Level of effort displayed in creativity and user experience. ✅
